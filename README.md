### Elevator pitch

Are you tired of tracking your workouts only to lose your notes? Have you wanted to brag to your friends and family about your rediculously impressive bench press? The Fit Tracker allows you to effortlessly track your workout of the day and your 1 rep maxes for your favorite lifts. Others can log in and see your most recent workout where they can like and comment on your routine in realtime for all users to see.

### Design
